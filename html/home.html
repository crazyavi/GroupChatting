<h3>The problem of merging two sorted lists arises frequently. We have seen a procedure
for it as the subroutine MERGE in Section 2.3.1. In this problem, we will
prove a lower bound of 2n  1 on the worst-case number of comparisons required
to merge two sorted lists, each containing n items.
First we will show a lower bound of 2n  o.n/ comparisons by using a decision
tree.</h3></br>
<h2>a.</h2><h3> Given 2n numbers, compute the number of possible ways to divide them into
two sorted lists, each with n numbers.</h3>
<h3>
b. Using a decision tree and your answer to part (a), show that any algorithm that
correctly merges two sorted lists must perform at least 2n  o.n/ comparisons.
Now we will show a slightly tighter 2n  1 bound.
c. Show that if two elements are consecutive in the sorted order and from different
lists, then they must be compared.
d. Use your answer to the previous part</h3>
<h3>22.2-3
Show that using a single bit to store each vertex color suffices by arguing that the
BFS procedure would produce the same result if lines 5 and 14 were removed.
22.2-4
What is the running time of BFS if we represent its input graph by an adjacency
matrix and modify the algorithm to handle this form of input?
22.2-5
Argue that in a breadth-first search, the value u:d assigned to a vertex u is independent
of the order in which the vertices appear in each adjacency list. Using
Figure 22.3 as an example, show that the breadth-first tree computed by BFS can
depend on the ordering within adjacency lists.
22.2-6
Give an example of a directed graph G D .V;E/, a source vertex s 2 V , and a
set of tree edges E  E such that for each vertex  2 V , the unique simple path
in the graph .V;E/ from s to  is a shortest path in G, yet the set of edges E
cannot be produced by running BFS on G, no matter how the vertices are ordered
in each adjacency list.
22.2-7
There are two types of professional wrestlers: “babyfaces” (“good guys”) and
“heels” (“bad guys”). Between any pair of professional wrestlers, there may or
may not be a rivalry. Suppose we have n professional wrestlers and we have a list
of r pairs of wrestlers for which there are rivalries. Give an O.n C r/-time algorithm
that determines whether it is possible to designate some of the wrestlers as
babyfaces and the remainder as heels such that each rivalry is between a babyface
and a heel. If it is possible to perform such a designation, your algorithm should
produce it.
22.2-8 ?
The diameter of a tree T D .V;E/ is defined as maxu;2V ı.u; /, that is, the
largest of all shortest-path distances in the tree. Give an efficient algorithm to
compute the diameter of a tree, and analyze the running time of your algorithm.
22.2-9
Let G D .V;E/ be a connected, undirected graph. Give an O.V C E/-time algorithm
to compute a path in G that traverses each edge in E exactly once in each
direction. Describe how you can find your way out of a maze if you are given a
large supply of pennies.</h3>
